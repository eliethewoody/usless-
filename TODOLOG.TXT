\=\3\ fancy way to handle memory

the most obvious solution is defining:
    (>^>) operator takes 2 arguments: MULTIPLEXER 0 and MULTIPLEXER 1
        it evaluates the first multiplexer(on the left side) and passes it into the right one as a Selector signal 
    (>->) operator takes 2 arguments: MULTIPLEXER 0 and MULTIPLEXER 1
        it evaluates the first multiplexer(on the left side) and passes it into the right one as a Negative input
    (>#>) operator takes 2 arguments: MULTIPLEXER 0 and MULTIPLEXER 1
        it evaluates the first multiplexer(on the left side) and passes it into the right one as a Zero input
    (>+>) operator takes 2 arguments: MULTIPLEXER 0 and MULTIPLEXER 1
        it evaluates the first multiplexer(on the left side) and passes it into the right one as a Positive input
    (>$>) operator takes 4 arguments
        it evaluates left 3 multiplexers as a tuple and passes their output as the MultilexerInput to the right one
